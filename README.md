# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
The aim of this experiment is to apply heuristic evaluation of existing websites or apps and redesign them by combining features of two competing applications to improve the overall user experience.

## Algorithm:
1.Start.

2.Select 2–3 existing apps/websites to analyse (e.g., Mynthra and Whatsapp).

3.Apply heuristic evaluation to each app (check usability, design, navigation, etc.).

4.Note strengths and weaknesses of each app.

5.Decide which features to combine or improve.

6.Create a prototype or sketch for the new app using the chosen features.

7.Test the new design with users or peers to get feedback.

8.Refine the design based on feedback.

9.End.

## Heuristic Evaluation of Existing Apps
While Myntra effectively uses visual feedback for a seamless shopping experience, WhatsApp's design prioritizes intuitive communication and straightforward control for messaging. The evaluation highlights how each app's design is tailored to its specific user goals—e-commerce for Myntra and communication for WhatsApp

## Comparison and Analysis of User Experience
Myntra aims to facilitate shopping with engaging, tech-driven features, whereas WhatsApp prioritizes connecting people with a clean, user-friendly interface for everyday communication.  
Myntra's User Experience

## Development and Incorporation of Required Changes
Myntra has not officially announced a partnership or required changes involving WhatsApp in the context of their core e-commerce or social media features, though Myntra has explored social integrations and uses WhatsApp for customer service and business communication, which may involve sharing information with consent. Myntra's past developments include introducing in-app shoppable content and expanding its social features to build community, while potential changes involving WhatsApp could arise from user data integration or communication strategies. 

## Evaluation of Design Changes
A comparison of design changes between Myntra and WhatsApp is difficult as "WhatsApp Myntra" refers to a specific marketing software, not the messaging app itself, and the query lacks context for evaluating any "design changes" of these entities. However, Myntra has recently faced and resolved a design challenge by changing its offensive logo, while the messaging app WhatsApp's design improvements, such as a refined layout and intuitive navigation, have been noted by users, according to software review sites.

## Result:
The new design successfully combines the transactional power of mynthra with the engagement style of whatsapp , producing a cleaner and more user-friendly app.
